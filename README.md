# Lab 6 – Image Gallery (JavaScript)

This project is a dynamic image gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
The goal of Lab 6 was to complete the JavaScript functionality inside `gallery.js`, specifically the instructions labeled **Lab 6 – Steps A to G**.

The gallery automatically generates thumbnail images, updates the main displayed image when any thumbnail is clicked, and applies visual “wayfinding” effects to highlight the currently selected image.

## 🧩 What Was Completed in `gallery.js`

The following required steps were implemented:

- **Step 1:** Declared variables for the main displayed image and the thumbnail bar.  
- **Step 2:** Generated 5 thumbnail `<img>` elements using a loop.  
- **Step 3:** (Commented out) Example of inline event handlers.  
- **Step 4:** Created `displayImage()` to update the main image.  
- **Step 5:** Implemented event delegation to detect clicks on thumbnails.  
- **Step A–C:** Applied outline, position, and z-index to the clicked thumbnail.  
- **Step D:** Selected all thumbnails using `querySelectorAll`.
